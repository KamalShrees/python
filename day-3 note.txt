in slicing
first position or limit (argument) is inclusive
last position is exclusive

here, inclusive means starts with exact what is given 
 for eg. (2,10)
 here the range starts with 2.

and, exclusive means, ends with (-1)
 for example (2,10)
here, the range is (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

( _ ) = dummy variable

iterable: 
An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time, 
permitting it to be iterated over in a for-loop. 
Familiar examples of iterables include lists, tuples, and strings
